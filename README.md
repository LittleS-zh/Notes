# Notes

Learning from [Junde Yhi](https://github.com/lmy441900), I decide to create a notes repository to store and share my notes taken in [UIC](http://uic.edu.hk).

This task may be boring and it will cost a lot of time, thus as usual, I may give up it if I don't want to do it anymore :D.

Please notice that these notes are repharesed by me, thus it will have **inevitabe error**. If you find any error in these notes, please contact me.
