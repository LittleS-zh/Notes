### 1. What is distributed system

#### Definition

A collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system. - S. Tanenbaum

A distributed system organized as middleware.

A distributed system is a collection of autonomous computers interconnected by a computer network and equipped
with distributed system software to form an integrated computing facility.

Distributed System and Processes:
- execute concurrently
- interact in order to co-operate to achieve a common goal
- co-ordinate their activities and exchange information by means of messages transferred over a communication network.

Distributed Application:
- A set of processes that are distributed across a network of machines and work together as an ensemble to common problems.

Typical examples:
- Internet (global network of interconnected computers, which communicate through IP protocols)
- Intranets (a portion of the internet with a boundary)
- Mobile and ubiquitous computing
    - laptops, PDAs, mobile phones, printers, home devices, ...
	- technological advance in device miniaturization and wireless networking.
- World-Wide Web (actually it is a part of internet, what we see using browser is part of world-wide web)

#### Characteristics of distributed systems:
- Concurrency
- No global clock
- Independent faliures

#### Main features:
- Geographical distribution of autonomous computers
- Communication through cable/fiber/wireless/... connections

### 2. Why Distributed Systems?

#### Advantages
- Interaction, co-operation, sharing resourses

#### Benefits
- Reduce costs, improved abailability and performance
- Scalability, resource sharing, fault tolerance

#### Importance of Distributed Computing

Distributed systems are critical for functioning of many organizations(banks, tansport, telecommunications...)

### 3. The Typical examples: Internet, Intranets, Mobile and ubiquitous computing, World-Wide Web

#### Characteristics of internets:
- large and heterogeneous
- open-ended
- connects intranets (via backbones) with home users (via modems, ISPs)

#### Characteristics of Intranets:
- Several LANs linked by backbones
- Enables information flow within an organization
- Provides various services
- Connected to Internet via router
- protected by firewall

#### Characteristics of ubiquitous computing:
- Wireless LANs(WLAN) uses WAP(Wireless Application Protocol)
- Home intranet
  - Devices embedded in home applications(hi-fi, washing machines,...)
  - Universal 'remote control' + communication
  
#### WWW
- world-wide resource sharing over Internet or Intranet
- base on HTML, URL, Client-Server architecture

### 4. Distributed Systems' Challenges
1. Heterogeneity
  - in network, hardware, OS...
  - Solution: need for standards of protocols and middleware
2. Openness (Difficulty of adding and using new resources)
  - Cumbersome and slow moving
  - Solving method: follow standardization
3. Security
  - confidentiality: protect against disclosure
  - integrity: protect against alteration and interference
  - in hospital/E-commerce/banking
4. Failure handling
  - software/hardware
  - detect, mask, tolerate, recovery from, redundancy
5. Concurrency
  - sharing resource need to be secure in concurrency environment
6. Transparency(Hide)
  - the migrate, update or error of each single part should be unseen by users.
  - types:
    - Access: enables local and remote resources to be accessed using identical operations
	- location: enables resources to be accessed without knowledge of their physical or network location
	- concurrency: enables several processes to operate concurrently using shared resources without interference between them
	- replication: enables multiple instances of resources to be used to increase reliability and performance without knowledge of the replicas by users or application programmers.
	- failure: enables the concealment of faults
	- mobility: allows the movement of resources and clients within a system without affecting the operation of users or programs.
	- performance: allows the system to be reconfigured to improve performance as loads vary
	- scaling: allow system and applications to expand in scale without change to the system structure or the application algorithms.
	- persistence: hide whether a software resource is in memory or on disk
7. Scalability
  - controlling the cost of physical resource
  - controlling the performance loss preventing software resource running out
  - avoiding performance bottleneck
  - decentralizaed algorithms
    - no machine has complete information about the system state
	- machines make decisions base only on local information
	- failure of one machine does not ruin the algorithm
	- There is no implicit assumption that a global clock exists

## Unfamiliar Worlds
coherent: forming a whole
concurrency: do a task together and at a same time
autonomous: having self-goverment
consequences: a result or effect of an action
middleware: act as a bridge between application and operating system. especially on a network
ensemble: a group of musician, performer, actors to perform together
ubiquitous: can be found everywhere
portion: a part of
typical: having the distinctive qualities of something
backbone: a high-speed digital connection which forms the axis of a local or wide area network
heterogeneous: diverse in content
open-ended: having no determined limit
ISP: Internet Service Provider
hi-fi: a set of equipment for high-fidelity sound reproduction, especially a radio or phonograph
cumbersome: large or heavy and therefore difficult to carry or use
vendor: a person or company offering something for sale
disclosure: make the secret information known
alteration: the action or process of change or being changed
interference: prevent from continuing or being carried out properly
implicit: not expressed directly
concealment: the action of hiding something or prevent it from being known
identical: same
replicas: a exact copy or model of something
concealment: hiding
