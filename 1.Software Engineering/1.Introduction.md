### 1.What is Software

#### Software is:
- Instructions that provide desired function
- Data structures that manipulate information
- Documents that describe the operations

> software is computer programs and associated documentation. -Sommerville
  
#### Software has these characteristics:
- Has no mass
- Cannot be manufactured now
- Does not "wear out", but "deteriorate"

#### Software Development History (from top to buttom)
Types|Simple Descriptions
-|-
House Software | simple codes for expensive hardware
Product Software | multi-user, real time
Distributed Software | microprocessor distributed, embedded
Network Software | cloud, mobile


### 2.What is Engineering

Engineering is the application of scientific and mathematical principles to pratical ends, it includes:
- analysis
- design
- constructions
- verifications
- management


### 3. What is Software Engineering
> The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable
> approach to the development, operation, and
> maintenance of software; that is, the application of
> engineering to software. -IEEE 93

Question to answer on software engineering:
- What is the problem?
- What characteristics the software need to solve the problem?
- How to construct the software?
- How to uncover errors?
- How to support over the long term?


### 4. Why is software engineering needed
- Examples of software crisis
  - IBM OS/360 operating systems in 1964 (multi-million dollar mistake)
  - HK International Airport chaos in 1998 (result of compressing testing time)
  - Therac 25 incidents between 1985-1987 (massive overdoses)
  
- we need software engineering to:
  - obtain high **quality**
  - Reduce development **cost**
  - Meet the **deadline**
