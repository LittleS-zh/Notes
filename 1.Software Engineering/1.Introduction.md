### 1.What Is Software

#### Software is 
- Instructions that provide desired function
- Data structures that manipulate information
- Documents that describe the operations

> software is computer programs and associated documentation. -Sommerville
  
#### Software has these characteristics
- Has no mass
- Cannot be manufactured now
- Does not "wear out", but "deteriorate"

#### Software Development History(Time from top to buttom)
Types|Simple Descriptions
-|-
House software | Simple codes for expensive hardware
Product software | Multi-user, real time
Distributed software | Microprocessor distributed, embedded
Network software | cloud, mobile

### 2.What Is Engineering

#### Engineering is
The application of scientific and mathematical principles to pratical ends, it includes:
- analysis
- design
- constructions
- verifications
- management

### 3. What Is Software Engineering
> the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable
> approach to the development, operation, and
> maintenance of software; that is, the application of
> engineering to software. -IEEE 93

Question to answer on software engineering:
- What is the problem?
- What characteristics the software need to solve the problem?
- How to construct the software?
- How to uncover errors?
- How to support over the long term?

### 4. Why is software engineering needed
- Counter examples
  - IBM OS/360 operating systems in 1964(multi-million dollar mistake)
  - HK International Airport chaos in 1998(Result of compressing testing time)
  - Therac 25 incidents between 1985-1987(massive overdoses)
  
- Purpose
  - Quality
  - Reduce cost
  - Meet the deadline
